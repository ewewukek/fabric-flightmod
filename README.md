## Flight Mod

Hunger-based flight for survival. With client-side flying mechanics tweaks. [Download from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flight-mod-fabric/files/all) [Download from modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/flight-mod-fabric/versions)

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu).

**Flight is available in singleplayer only.** But you can put this mod on your server.

### Main features (configurable):

- Hunger cost per tick while flying + per 1m flown horizontally + per 1m flown upwards
- Warning message when food level drops to certain level
- No longer immune to fall damage
- Can't fly inside water/lava
- Can't fly inside blocks that slow movement: cobwebs, sweet berry bushes and powder snow

### Client tweaks (configurable):

- Modified flying movement. 3D flight if looking above/below certain degree. Makes landing on thin ledges easier.
- Inertia compensation for side movement while flying forward. Lets you make sharp turns.
- Extra keyboard shortcuts. Pressing Space key while falling will enable flight, pressing Shift+Space will disable flight.

Movement modification has three modes:

- vanilla - disabled
- vanilla vertical - cap vertical speed at vanilla values
- full speed - fly at full speed in any direction! **(may be considered as unfair advantage by some servers)**

**Client tweaks are available in multiplayer too but disabled by default.** Settings are stored per-server.
