Fabric mod that adds hunger-based flight for survival. Can be used as client only mod for creative flight tweaks.

[Download from modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/flight-mod/versions)

Requires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

**Flight is available in singleplayer only unless also installed on a server.**

### Main features:

- Hunger cost per tick while flying + per 1m flown horizontally + per 1m flown upwards
- Warning message when food level drops to certain level
- No longer immune to fall damage
- Can't fly inside water/lava
- Can't fly inside blocks that slow movement: cobwebs, sweet berry bushes and powder snow

### Client tweaks:

- Modified flying movement. 3D flight if looking above/below certain degree. Makes landing on thin ledges easier
- Inertia compensation for side movement while flying forward. Lets you make sharp turns
- Extra keyboard shortcuts. Pressing Space key while falling will enable flight, pressing Shift+Space will disable flight

Movement modification has three modes:

- vanilla - disabled
- vanilla vertical - cap vertical speed at vanilla values
- full speed - fly at full speed in any direction! **(may be considered as unfair advantage by some servers)**

**Client tweaks are available in multiplayer too but disabled by default.** Settings are stored per-server.
